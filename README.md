## Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 13.0+ or iPadOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+ (for building from source)
- Active Readwise account with API access

### Building from Source

1. Clone this repository:

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readwise-display.git
cd readwise-display
```

2. Open `ReadwiseDisplay.xcodeproj` in Xcode

3. Select your target platform (macOS or iPad)

4. Build and run the project

## Setup

### Getting Your Readwise API Key

1. Visit [Readwise Access Token page](https://readwise.io/access_token)
2. Log in to your Readwise account
3. Copy your API token

### Configuring the App

**macOS:**
- Use the native Settings menu (ReadwiseDisplay â†’ Settings...)

**iPad:**
- Tap the gear icon in the top-right corner of the main screen

Enter your API key and configure your preferred refresh interval.

## Usage

### Main Interface
- **Tap anywhere** on the main screen to refresh the quote immediately
- The app automatically fetches new quotes based on your configured interval
- Background colors subtly change with each new quote for variety

### Settings

- **API Key**: Enter and manage your Readwise API token
- **Visibility Toggle**: Show/hide your API key while editing

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for network operations
- **@AppStorage**: Secure, persistent settings storage
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared codebase with platform-specific optimizations

### Quote Fetching Algorithm
The app uses an intelligent approach to ensure true randomness:

1. **Count Caching**: Fetches total highlight count once and caches it
2. **Random Page Selection**: Calculates total pages and selects a random page
3. **Random Highlight**: Picks a random highlight from the selected page
4. **Data Enrichment**: Automatically fetches missing book/author details when available

### Responsive Design
- **Dynamic Font Scaling**: Automatically adjusts text size based on device and orientation
- **iPad Pro Support**: Larger fonts and spacing for 12.9" displays
- **Orientation Aware**: Different layouts for portrait and landscape modes
- **Safe Area Handling**: Proper support for notches, home indicators, and rounded corners

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All settings stored locally on your device
- **Secure API Storage**: API keys stored in system keychain
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, telemetry, or user tracking
- **Network Only**: Only communicates with Readwise API servers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key required" message:**
- Ensure you've entered your API key in Settings
- Verify the key is correct by checking the Readwise website
- Make sure your internet connection is working

**No quotes appearing:**
- Check that you have highlights in your Readwise library
- Verify your API key has the necessary permissions
- Try refreshing manually by tapping the screen

**App won't compile:**
- Ensure you're using Xcode 15.0 or later
- Check that all required frameworks are available
- Clean build folder and rebuild
